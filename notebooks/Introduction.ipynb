    "\n",
    "In April of 2019, I have created a video which is called `Discord \"Big\" Data`. For this video, I created a Discord Bot with the code name `Kirby` which is able to collect sets of data like every time when a message was sent, a user joined or left the guild, changed their status and much more. All the data was collected, anonymized and then saved to a MongoDB database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you can find the repository of `Kirby`:  \n",
    "https://github.com/dev-schueppchen/Kirby\n",
    "\n",
    "This bot was then set up on my *(mostly german)* [development Discord guild](https://dc.zekro.de) and collected data, until now.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yes, the bot is still collecting data each day. This notebook directly connects to the kirby database via a publicly avaliable read-only account.  \n",
    "Here you can see an example query which shows the current count of documents for each collection:"
